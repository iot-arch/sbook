## Move static content to `static`
Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with `_` will be copied as-is to the `_site` output. Hugo keeps all static content under `static`. You should therefore move it all there.
With Jekyll, something that looked like

    ▾ <root>/
        ▾ images/
            logo.png

should become

    ▾ <root>/
        ▾ static/
            ▾ images/
                logo.png

Additionally, you'll want any files that should reside at the root (such as `CNAME`) to be moved to `static`.

## Create your Hugo configuration file
Hugo can read your configuration as JSON, YAML or TOML. Hugo supports parameters custom configuration too. Refer to the [Hugo configuration documentation](/overview/configuration/) for details.

## Set your configuration publish folder to `_site`
The default is for Jekyll to publish to `_site` and for Hugo to publish to `public`. If, like me, you have [`_site` mapped to a git submodule on the `gh-pages` branch](http://blog.blindgaenger.net/generate_github_pages_in_a_submodule.html), you'll want to do one of two alternatives:

1. Change your submodule to point to map `gh-pages` to public instead of `_site` (recommended).

        git submodule deinit _site
        git rm _site
        git submodule add -b gh-pages git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git public

2. Or, change the Hugo configuration to use `_site` instead of `public`.

        {
            ..
            "publishdir": "_site",
            ..
        }
